# README

This simple app is used to show how to refactor non restful route to restful route in Ruby on Rails. You can find the article where I explain it at https://agung-setiawan.com/restful-route-di-ruby-on-rails-done-right/ (in Indonesia).

The study case is using granting and revoking a user as an admin or the other way around as an example. From using custom controller action on `UsersController` to create separate `AdminsController` with its standar restful actions.
